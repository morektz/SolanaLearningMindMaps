# Repo Description 

This repo will contain mind maps which I will generate primairly for my own understanding of solana in general. No long paragarphs, just mindmaps and diagrams. Which will be done in [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/). They will be listed in the table below

Default plantuml is quite outdated on gitpod, yaml will install the latest version. For generating diagrams use command line 

`plantuml <filename>`

Plantuml installation takes a few minutes is problematic. Start work after plantuml is installed completely


# Mindmap Table 

Note some diagrams are quite large, so they are hosted at a third party site. You can download them locally to view them from the pix folder.
